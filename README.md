# Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition

This repository contains an implementation of the paper **"[Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf)"** by Koch, Zemel, and Salakhutdinov. The approach is designed to perform one-shot image recognition, enabling the system to recognize new classes with a single example.

## Overview

One-shot learning is a challenging machine learning problem where the goal is to train models capable of recognizing a class from just one example. This implementation uses Siamese Neural Networks to address the problem by learning a similarity metric between pairs of images. Instead of classifying images directly, the model determines whether two images belong to the same class.

### Key Features:
- **Siamese Neural Network Architecture**: A pair of neural networks sharing weights and trained to minimize a contrastive loss function.
- **One-shot Learning**: Capable of recognizing unseen classes with just one labeled example.
- **Contrastive Loss**: Encourages the network to output embeddings that are close for similar pairs and far apart for dissimilar pairs.

## Paper Summary

The paper proposes:
1. **Siamese Neural Networks**: Designed to compare two images by computing a similarity score.
2. **Training**: Models are trained on image pairs with a contrastive loss function.
3. **Testing**: New classes are introduced, and the model classifies images based on the similarity score with the provided example.

## Implementation Details

### Dependencies
To run the code, you will need the following Python libraries:
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive experimentation)

### Files in this Repository
- `main.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the complete implementation of the Siamese Neural Network for one-shot image recognition.
- `data/`: Placeholder directory for the dataset. Ensure to structure your dataset as described below.

### Dataset
The implementation requires image datasets organized in pairs. Common datasets for testing one-shot learning models include Omniglot or mini-ImageNet.

**Dataset Structure**:
```
data/
  train/
    class1/
      img1.jpg
      img2.jpg
    class2/
      ...
  test/
    ...
```

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd <repo_directory>
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
4. Open `main.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially to:
   - Preprocess the data.
   - Define the Siamese Neural Network architecture.
   - Train the model.
   - Evaluate on a one-shot learning task.

### Results
After training, the model will output similarity scores for image pairs, which can be used for classification tasks. Accuracy and other metrics will depend on the dataset and training configuration.
